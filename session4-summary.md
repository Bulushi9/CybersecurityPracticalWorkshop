## Key Concepts

### What is Ethical Hacking?

- **Definition**: Authorized testing of systems to find and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Goal**: Strengthen security by simulating real-world attacks with permission.
- Ethical hackers must:
  - Have documented consent
  - Stay within the scope
  - Report findings responsibly

### Hacking Methodologies – 5 Phases

1. **Reconnaissance** (Footprinting)
2. **Scanning & Enumeration**
3. **Gaining Access**
4. **Maintaining Access**
5. **Covering Tracks**

## Hands-On Activities

### OWASP Juice Shop Demo

We explored OWASP Juice Shop — a purposely vulnerable web app designed for learning web security. Activities included:

- **Basic Login Bypass**
  - Using weak default credentials to access the system.

- **SQL Injection Login**
  - Injecting `' OR 1=1--` into the login field to bypass authentication.

These demonstrated how poor input validation and insecure authentication can expose web apps to attackers.

### Case Study Discussions

- **Capital One (2019)**
- **British Airways (2018)**
- **Uber (2022)**

## Cybersecurity Laws & Ethics

Covered global regulations like PIPEDA, GDPR, and CFAA, and emphasized the need for responsible disclosure and consent in ethical hacking.

## Final Exam Overview

- **Date**: March 27 – April 2  
- **Format**: Closed-book, 1.5 hours  
- **Topics**: Cyber Threats, OWASP, Network Security, Incident Response, Ethics

## Key Takeaways

- OWASP Juice Shop is a practical tool for testing real-world vulnerabilities safely.
- Ethical hacking teaches you to think like an attacker — and act like a defender.
- Laws and ethics are crucial to cybersecurity professionalism.
