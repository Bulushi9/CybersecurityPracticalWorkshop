# Cybersecurity Practical - Session 3 Summary

## Application Security & Cyber Defense

Session 3 focused on securing web applications, identifying common vulnerabilities, and understanding how organizations respond to cyber threats.

## Key Concepts

### OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities
A list of the most critical security risks for web applications:
1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection Attacks (e.g., SQL Injection)
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable & Outdated Components
7. Identification & Authentication Failures
8. Software & Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Each of these vulnerabilities can lead to serious security breaches if not properly mitigated.

### Application Security Insights
- 80% of cyberattacks target web applications.
- Preventing vulnerabilities during development is cheaper than fixing them post-breach.
- Real-world example: Equifax breach (2017) due to an unpatched app vulnerability.

## Incident Response

### The 6 Phases of Incident Response
1. **Preparation** – Security policies, employee training, threat detection setup
2. **Detection & Analysis** – Identifying breaches and attack types
3. **Containment** – Isolating affected systems and stopping the spread
4. **Eradication** – Removing malware and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery** – Restoring services, validating systems, monitoring
6. **Post-Incident Review** – Learning from the attack and improving processes

## Hands-On Activity

- **Threat Hunting**: Identified Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and matched tactics using real-world tools.
- Explored how to use OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding OWASP Top 10 is critical for web app defense.
- Incident response requires a structured and fast-acting process.
- Real-time monitoring and logging help detect threats early.
- Threat intelligence and hunting are core skills in cybersecurity teams (like SOCs).

## Final Thought

Secure applications are built — not patched. Defend proactively and always be prepared to respond to incidents with speed and clarity.
