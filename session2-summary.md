# Cybersecurity Practical - Session 2 Summary

## Network & Data Security

In Session 2, we explored the fundamentals of securing network infrastructure and data. The session focused on understanding how to defend systems through layered security and encryption.

## Key Concepts

- **Network Security Principles**
  - Firewalls: Filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on rules.
  - IDS/IPS: Monitor and (in IPS) block malicious activity in real time.
  - VPNs: Encrypt internet traffic and protect data over public networks.

- **Encryption Methods**
  - **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
  - **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt (e.g., RSA).

- **Authentication & MFA**
  - Single-Factor Authentication (SFA): Password only (least secure).
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Combines passwords with other methods (e.g., phone code or biometrics).
  - Biometric methods include fingerprint and facial recognition.

## Key Takeaways

- Firewalls and IDS/IPS are essential for network defense.
- Encryption secures data during transmission and at rest.
- VPNs protect user privacy on public networks.
- MFA significantly improves authentication security.

## Final Thought

A secure network is your first line of defense. Encryption, awareness, and strong policies help prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.
